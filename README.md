# Moves

Demo of a mobile app idea

To test, host the repo on a localhost port using <code>$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000</code>. Navigate to localhost:8000/moves in chrome(you will see side effects in other browsers). To get past login, select the password field and press enter. The only button functional on the "home" screen is the Uber request ride button. Select that to be navigated to a confirmation screen and then back to the home screen.

Other option is to open https://seththeeke.github.io/moves in your mobile chrome browser. Or you can use chrome on a laptop and change viewing modes to iphone 6/7/8

The hosted version may not always be accessible.
